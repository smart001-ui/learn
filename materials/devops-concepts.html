        <h2>What is DevOps?</h2>
        <p>DevOps is a combination of <strong>Development</strong> and <strong>Operations</strong>, focused on fostering collaboration between software development and IT operations teams. It combines <strong>culture</strong>, <strong>tools</strong>, and <strong>practices</strong> to enable organizations to deliver software faster and with greater reliability.</p>

        <h3>Key Aspects of DevOps:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Continuous Integration (CI):</strong> Frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Delivery (CD):</strong> Automating the release process to deploy updates quickly.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Example image placeholder for DevOps overview -->

        <h2>Why DevOps?</h2>
        <p>DevOps offers several advantages that help organizations deliver software more effectively:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Faster Software Delivery:</strong> Reduce time-to-market by deploying updates quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Collaboration:</strong> Break down silos between development and operations teams.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Infrastructure:</strong> Automate infrastructure setup and management through tools like Infrastructure as Code (IaC).</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Security and Reliability:</strong> Incorporate security and reliability into the deployment pipeline.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)</h2>
        <p>DevOps integrates into each stage of the SDLC, transforming how software is developed, tested, and deployed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Collaborative planning across teams.</li>
            <li><strong>Development:</strong> Continuous development and frequent integrations.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Automated testing to detect issues early.</li>
            <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Automated deployments using CI/CD pipelines.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Continuous monitoring and quick resolution of issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Real-life DevOps Cycle</h2>
        <p>A typical DevOps cycle in a real-life scenario includes several key processes that repeat continuously to ensure the development and deployment of high-quality software:</p>
        
        <h3>Continuous Development</h3>
        <p>Development teams continuously work on new features and enhancements, maintaining the codebase in version control systems like Git.</p>

        <h3>Continuous Integration (CI)</h3>
        <p>As developers push changes, automated builds and tests run to ensure code quality. For example, a feature to add a new payment option in a financial app might trigger automated tests to validate functionality.</p>

        <h3>Continuous Testing</h3>
        <p>Automated test cases are triggered to ensure the application works as expected. These tests may include unit tests, functional tests, and security scans.</p>

        <!-- Example image placeholder for CI/CD pipeline -->
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/900x300.png?text=CI%2FCD+Pipeline" alt="CI/CD Pipeline">

        <h3>Continuous Deployment (CD)</h3>
        <p>Once code passes all tests, it is automatically deployed to a staging or production environment using tools like Jenkins, Azure Pipelines, or GitHub Actions.</p>

        <h3>Continuous Monitoring</h3>
        <p>After deployment, monitoring tools like Azure Monitor or Splunk continuously track the application’s performance, providing alerts for any anomalies.</p>

        <h3>Continuous Feedback</h3>
        <p>Feedback from users and monitoring systems helps teams identify areas for improvement, driving further iterations in the development cycle.</p>

        <h2>Real-Life Example: Netflix and DevOps</h2>
        <p>Netflix is an excellent example of an organization using DevOps practices. With a global user base, Netflix needs to constantly update its platform while ensuring high availability and performance. They achieve this by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Continuous Development:</strong> Developers at Netflix continuously work on new features like improving content recommendations.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Integration and Testing:</strong> Automated tests ensure new features do not break the platform or degrade performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Deployment:</strong> Netflix can release new features globally in minutes using CI/CD pipelines.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Tools like Chaos Monkey test Netflix's system resilience by randomly disabling services to ensure the platform can withstand failures.</li>
        </ul>
